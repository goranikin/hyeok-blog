## Omnifocus 4 and GTD for my habits

First, I'm going to share my setup of Omnifocus 4.

### Project View

It has some directories, Projects, Areas of Responsibility, Someday / Maybe, Waiting For.

'Projects' is for a project that has finite outcomes with an end.
On my setup, there are the projects that I'm handling with at my company.
Besides, there is my personal project to read papers.
I'll continue to read a paper but that has a specific goal to take some narrow field.
So I designate it in 'Projects'.

'Areas of Responsibility' means ongoing standards with no end, as you see that it has some categories such as
Career Development, Relationship, Financial Management and e.t.c.
They have many routines repeated for a constant period, and also weekly to-do lists for ordinary days.
For latters, I appoint days to work out for a week, because it is hard to fix a day of week for exercise due to other schedules.
