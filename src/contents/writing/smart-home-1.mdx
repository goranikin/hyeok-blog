description: record of structuring a smart home.

Recently, I bought a mini PC to run some web pages, including my personal blog.
I've found it quite enjoyable to set everything up - though it's also pretty fastidious.
I feel like I don't fully understand what I'm doing and just follow instructions.
I think it might be a great opportunity to dive deeper into the world of development,
so I've decided to build a smart home with the mini PC.

I'm going to document what I did to build my smart home.

1. There is an open source for a smart home - Home Assistant. (Run it via a docker container in the mini PC)
2. Zigbee based communication

Here's what I bought for that.
1. **Gateway**: SONOFF ZBDongle-P Zigbee 3.0 USB
- It's necessary for connecting smart devices. I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but think of it as a mediator between smart devices and a server.
It lets me control devices through the Home Assistant dashboard, which runs in a Docker container.

2. **Thermo-hygrometer**: SONOFF SNZB-02D
- Yes, it is a just thermo-hygrometer.

3. **Smart socket**: 다원디엔에스 IoT smart plug 16A
- I was quite surprised by the price - almost $30 for just one outlet!
However, I think it's the best choice because there's no reason to use a sketchy outlet
that could cause serious electrical problems, like overheating or even a fire.
Also, I believe it'll last a long time, so it's not really overpaying in the long run. :D

I'll write my next post after I've set up all the devices!
