title: Dalpha, and 8 weeks

description: Review for the 8 weeks at Dalpha.
---

The summer's feeling in the air has already gone, I'm in the middle of the huge holiday, Chuseok(추석).
Time has been flying by during my 8 weeks working at Dalpha.

I had a few questions before joining the startup where I'm working as an AI engineer.
Some questions are about me.

- Can I fulfill my responsibilities in the business? (Am I useful?)
- Can I really have fun and enjoy the environment of a startup, where the people are pursuing their goals relentlessly?

Others are about the field on which I want to step, AI.

- How do AI companies like Dalpha generate revenue in actual business scenarios?
- Is AI fully powerful to replace everything in the world?

---

For the former questions, I thought I should prove that I'm really 'useful' in the real world,
because I didn't have any experience outside the fence of school and moreover, I thought
it would be hard to contribute to 'a better world' with only good intentions and no pragmatic skills.
Therefore, I wanted to stop searching for reasons to live and asking 'why' and
instead lead a practical life while avoiding nihilism.

The first step was finding and joining a startup that creates something valuable.
In particular, I wanted to find a place that where everyone is fully motivated and enjoys working hard.
Deep down, I needed to grow.

Fortunately, I had a good chance to learn. Dalpha was the place that I was looking for,
where people work hard, and I have a lot to learn from them.
Also, there are opportunities to participate in projects independently.
I took on a PoC which a client payment of 3.6M won (around $3K), and if I succeed,
it would be 1.6M won per month for the subscription period.
Because I was only 2 weeks into the job, I wasn't sure if it was okay for me to handle it myself!
Right now, I've settled into this environment, and I like that I have to figure things out myself.
(Of course, everyone I ask kindly answers even when my questions are absurd or unnecessary.
I couldn't have done my things without the help of my colleagues.
I'm really thankful to Dalpha for giving me an envrionment where I can ask anything!!)

This will be the last time I work at a company in my twenties, since I believe there is no better place to work than Dalpha.
So, when I leave the company, I will continue to learn by finding and answering the questions that no one has explored.
When that time comes, I hope to hear that I really worked hard and I brought significant value to the firm,
not that I just exploited the company for my own gain. I genuinely want to find the way where both employee and employer benefit.

The latter questions concern my interest in AI. Is it really used effectively in business?
Dalpha has been developing AI solutions that supersede human labor to create value in the B2B funnel.

Well, I have been being skeptical about the capabilities of AI, evem though I'm working at an AI company.
Honestly, I don't believe AI will repace all human labor or render humanity worthless in the near future.
I'm deeply impressed by the post [iRobot Founder: Don't Believe The Hype!], so I'm borrowing a paragraph from it.

> There’s a tendency to go for the flashy demo, but the flashy demo doesn’t deal with the real environment. It’s going to have to operate in the messy reality. That’s why it takes so long for these technologies.

It could, in my opinion, be applied to all practical uses of current AI.
Sure, I'm not denying that AI is making a revolution in human society and it opens a new age.
I'm relying on its ability in many aspects, so I would be in a harsh ordeal if LLMs disappered.
However, we should not lose a focus on the core, though it's not 'sexy'.

> It turns around and tells the central system that this aisle is blocked. It’s simple intelligence, which is what we can do today and make reliable. It’s not sexy. It’s technology in the service of making things easier for workers and more efficient.

I'm in this sort of sexy technology startup right now. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that I have to concentrate on sexy things only.
I want to share what my close friend Claude told me:

```markdown
Are you using our conversations to build your own understanding,
or are you treating Claude as an external memory/knowledge store? The latter can create dependency.

What would happen if Claude disappeared tomorrow? Would you be able to:

Explain rankability to someone else in your own words?
Apply these concepts to a different paper?
Remember the key insights without re-reading our chat?

If not, you might be using Claude as a crutch rather than a tool for building durable understanding.
```

Besides, I found a post that puts my thoughts into words. [Prof. Oh said on LinkedIn]

I'll try to follow these rules as much as I can.

- Write and read anything like code, posts, or papers on my own without any help from AI. It is necessary to do on one's own capability, especially in this new era.
- Check my understanding and get direction for correcting errors I might miss. Just use LLms as a supplementary tool.
- With the principles above, do not restrict myself to them. Be open to new technology and adopt it flexibly. Sometimes vibe-coding is very efficient, and there is no reason not to use it at all. The most important thig is moderation. (모든 건 적당히)

I don't have 100% confidence in everything I wrote above. Someday I might change my mind and focus on the sexy things.
So, just treat them as my beliefs, not as prophecy. Of course, I intend to stand strongly by my values.
