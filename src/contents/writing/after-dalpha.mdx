There have been a few significant events over the past three months. First, I left my job
in November 2025. Why? I'm going to explain briefly.

It's hard to do things that feel meaningful in the company at the level of an undergraduate
with limited industry experience. Sure, what feels meaningful involves multiple aspects.
I can't share everything, but for me one factor is social contribution, which isn't part of
Dalpha's core mission. Honestly, I don't want to say it's only about money when I'm working.
I hope this doesn't mean I don't care about how a business model generates revenue. My view
hasn't changed: you have to take a company's cash flow seriously. Money comes first in
capitalism, and especially in a startup.

I knew that an early-stage startup is a place where a newcomer can grow extremely quickly
when I joined Dalpha. However, a very early-stage startup has to focus on survival rather
than employee development, even if that means treating employees as replaceable components
through financial leverage. If I want to develop my skills and build my career simultaneously,
I need sufficient capabilities to handle both appropriately, and I think those capabilities
come from minimal industry or academic experience. I knew I was an appentice who had to learn
the fundamentals of real business, so I needed more time to grow. By that point, I realized
I didn't want to pursue Dalpha's business direction in the near future, so I concluded I
should leave the compan.

Dalpha taught me many things--both hard skills like development, infrastructure, and business
goal-setting, and soft skills like communication with colleagues, meeting facilitation, and
staying motivated in a startup environment. However, I didn't want to spend a significant
portion of my twenties there. I want to learn during a time when I can dedicate my days
entirely to myself.
